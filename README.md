NO₂ Prediction Dashboard — Project 7

This repository contains a Streamlit user interface built for Project 7.
The app allows users to interact with a trained NO₂ concentration prediction model created in Project 5.

The Streamlit dashboard makes it possible to:
	•	Select or type in a city
	•	Choose the season, year, month, and day of the year
	•	Enter previous NO₂ measurements
	•	Receive a predicted NO₂ concentration (µg/m³) generated by the model

Files in This Repository

project7_app.py

This is the main Streamlit application.
It loads the trained model (no2_rf_pipeline.pkl), displays user input widgets, and performs predictions.

no2_rf_pipeline.pkl

The trained Random Forest Regression model from Project 5.
It includes full preprocessing (OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler) and the fitted estimator.
